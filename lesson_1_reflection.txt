How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it was easy ti spot a typo error as you can quick compare the + and - snippets.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    backtracking is essential to recover pieces of code that might be useful at a later stage.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    it's relevant to a logical change in the code. so it's easier to track
    changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    it's great as you can se interdependencies across for example JS CSS and HTML.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log lists all the ID of each commit and git diff allows me to compare
    2 commits and check what has been added and what has been deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can track previous version of my commits and compare them so I can
    find the bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To Experiment with code with confidence ;)
